    <p>Hello, my name is Aidan Carey. I'm a second year computer science student at Acadia University. I have a passion for computer programming and listening to and playing music.</p>

    <p>My learning objectives for this course are to learn how to work with server software like Apache, how to use front-end Javascript frameworks such as React and Vue, and to learn how to work with databases directly without using an ORM. The topic that most interests me about this course is Vue.js, because I've tried it out previously and enjoyed working with it.</p>
